As there are more cases, so the number of deaths in line with this rate will increase. These are the same trends for the country too. “In addition, we reflected on the comorbidities of patients who had died, and noted that those who have underlying health conditions, and those of an older age, are at the greatest risk. Minister Mkhize noted that these were similar trends in the rest of the country too”.
