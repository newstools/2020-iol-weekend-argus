Earlier on Saturday, President Cyril Ramaphosa convened a virtual meeting of government's Coordinating Council, which comprises Ministers, the premiers of all nine provinces and representatives from the South African Local Government Association. The Council discussed the response of all the provinces to Covid-19 and the planned move of most of South Africa towards alert level 3 of the lockdown. The National Department of Health was among the attendees who delivered presentations. "The Western Cape presented its hotspot strategy to the group, as the provincial response to the number of infections in nine geographical areas. "These areas - in each of the City of Cape Town's eight sub-districts, and in Witzenberg account for a large proportion of the Western Cape's infections. Using the data and evidence available to us, we will be able to specifically target these areas with responses from across government departments. The National Command Council will meet on Sunday where further deliberations will take place on the matters arising from Saturday's meeting. * For the latest on the Covid-19 outbreak, visit IOL's special #coronavirus page. ** If you think you have been exposed to the Covid-19 virus, please call the 24-hour hotline on 0800 029 999 or visit sacoronavirus.co.za IOL
