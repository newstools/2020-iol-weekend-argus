It seems that trolls aren't going to let go of the idea that Mohale Motaung is only with Somizi Mhlongo because of money go to rest. Taking to Twitter on Saturday, Motaung posted a selfie of him in the newlyweds' Mercedes Benz G-Wagon. One user then decided to throw some shade and said: "When are you buying your own car?"   Tweeps came to Motaung's defence telling @MmasieT to mind her business and referring to her as bitter.               However, the "Living The Dream With Somizi" star put the troll in their place clapping back and said: "Iâ€™ll buy my own car when you remove those gold stuff you have on your teeth, deal?"   Somhale also finished their white wedding planning on Sunday, with the "Idols SA" judge posting a video of them with their wedding planners.  The final planning for the white wedding. eish the stress....but we are in good hands with @liquidimageconsulting @zavionkotzeeventscompany A post shared by  Somizi (@somizi) on Jan 4, 2020 at 6:26am PST  The wedding is set to take place later this month.
