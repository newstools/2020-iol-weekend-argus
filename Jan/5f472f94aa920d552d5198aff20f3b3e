Durban - In what can be described as adrenaline fueled proposal, a Durban couple promised to spend the rest of their lives together while a car performed donuts around them. The 3-minute video posted on Dala U Crew has gone viral on social media with over 20k view in less than 15 hours. In the video the man is seen on one knee holding a balloon with the words "Will you Marry Me", while a BMW performs donuts around them. The couple seemed unfazed as the car performs donuts around them and continue with their proposal. The man then places a ring on the woman's finger and her agreement is met with cheers from friends, family and on-lookers.   A biker then arrives and lets off purple smoke and the woman is given the balloons. Towards the end of the video, a Metro Police vehicle is seen approaching the fanfare.
