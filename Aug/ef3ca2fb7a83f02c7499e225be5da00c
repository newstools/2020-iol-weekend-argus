Cape Town - A decrease in water consumption by Cape Metro residents over the past week will have a positive effect on the city’s water situation, according to a council official. Mayco member for water and waste, Xanthea Limberg, said: “The total capacity of dams supplying the Cape Metro increased by 2.6% to 80.4% for the week August 3 to 10, while consumption for the same period decreased by 33 million litres per day to an average of 643 million litres per day. “For the previous week, dam levels were at 77.8%. At the same time last year, dam levels were at 80.1%. “Although there are still almost two months left of the traditionally rainy season, it looks like there is a good probability that we will go into spring and summer in a fairly strong position, especially considering continued low consumption by residents.” Meanwhile, speaking about dam levels across the whole province, Local Government MEC Anton Bredell said: “The average dam level for dams in the province has increased to 62.2%.” “The latest prediction by the South African Weather Service indicates that some more light rainfall can be expected across parts of the province during the remainder of this week. In addition, gale force winds are expected between Cape Point and Cape Agulhas on Wednesday (today). “Nevertheless some regions continue to struggle. The interior parts of the province, particularly in the agricultural sector of the Karoo regions, remain in distress,” said Bredell. Cape Argus
