A NEW festive season pantomime presents the popular children’s fairytale classic Cinderella in a world addicted to social media with a Cape Flats twist. All Star Entertainment and GrandWest presents Cinderella & FrikaDella from Monday until December 20, at the Roxy Revue Bar. The production follows the ruthless mother and talent agent Patricia D who manages her social media “influencer” daughters Frika and Della, who both possess limited talent. The talented stepdaughter Cinderella is ignored and treated badly. However, her fate is about to change when a massive talent competition is announced. Cinderella secretly enters it, and the rest will unfold at the Roxy Revue Bar GrandWest Casino and Entertainment World. Written and directed by well-known performer Allistair Izobell, it features a cast including Loukmaan Adams as Patricia D, Cheswyn Ruiters as the Prince and Nicoleen Saal as Cinderella. Izobell will alternate the role of the evil mother with Adams. “It was a team effort, creating the synopsis and what this journey was going to be, and then writing,” said Izobell. To make the show relatable, Izobell wanted to create a scenario that the audience was living in: a world  wrapped up in social media. “They (the audience) can relate to the storyline and the lingo, and to the language,” he added. Izobell said the story could help people identify the strengths of social media and use it with responsibility, and how one can be irresponsible with it. Meanwhile, making her debut as a producer, Olivia Gildenhuys said: “Social media keeps us glued to our phones and keeps us up to date on everybody else’s life, whether it is real or not.” She said they adapted the story to highlight local flavour. “The cast makes it relevant for the city and in a language that is symbolic with the Cape Flats, bringing an underlying message along with the typical fairy tale,” she said. Tickets are available at Quicket at R120 for weekday tickets and R150 for weekend tickets.
