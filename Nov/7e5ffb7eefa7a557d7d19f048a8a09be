 A NEW centre to support victims of gender-based violence (GBV), will focus on preventative programmes for men and boys, as well as support them at the facility. This was announced at the opening of the non-profit organisation Philisa Abafazi Bethu (PAB) Family Centre situated in Steenberg earlier this week. The PAB was established in 2008 by community activist Lucinda Evans to support victims of GBV in the surrounding communities. The project was also supported by the Mayoral Urban Renewal Project that uplifts former neglected and dysfunctional areas, among other partners. PAB will house admin offices, a safe-house, meeting rooms, a multi-purpose hall for community activities, a school after-care centre, as well as neighbourhood watch and ER facilities. Evans said: “We are so excited that the centre is finally complete and now open to provide support services to women and children. The centre will act as a beacon of hope for many families.” She added that the centre looks forward to working with different families, in association with various organisations that not only provide support to women and children, but to men and young boys too. At the launch Evans asked why there were no safe spaces for men. “Men that will come forward and say that they need help. Where are the safe spaces for young boys that need the support equally?” she asked. Evans added that in emergency situations, if you are a gay individual and you have been raped and you are looking for a facility, “we want to offer our bed for 72 hours”. “My social worker would be able to work with you in terms of an emergency plan. If you need to be in a longer term shelter, they can do that,” she said. Through the boy child programme and the youths men's programme, her team will work around life skills and speak about gender-based violence prevention.
