With Cape Town’s art and theatre scene slowly returning, the stage is set once again for a dose of classic opera. From October 28 to 31, the Cape Town Opera and the UCT Opera School will stage a production of Cosi fan tutte at the Baxter Theatre Centre. “Così fan tutte is a fascinating ambiguity: it is a sparkling and delicious comedy until it suddenly isn’t,” said the opera’s director, Steven Stead. The opera was written by Austrian composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and had its debut performance in Vienna in 1790. The play follows the story of two men who place a bet that each of their fiancées will be able to seduce the two of them. “I have loved this opera for all its contradictions and rich texture ever since I first heard it as an opera-mad teenager,” Stead said. “It is still without doubt one of my favourite operas. “One of the things I love most about it is the fact that every time I engage with the piece, it reveals another aspect of itself. “It cannot be pinned down, and refuses to be categorised. “It is as complicated and messy, uplifting and heart-breaking as it is to be human; there are no absolutes. “Only the feelings and evidence of the moment.” The production will feature members of the Cape Town Opera Young Artists group alongside singers from the UCT Opera school, backed by the UCT Symphony Orchestra conducted by Jeremy Silver.
