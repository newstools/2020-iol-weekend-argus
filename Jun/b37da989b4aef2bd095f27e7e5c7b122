Cape Town - After their protest on Friday, the matrics at Bishops Diocesan College have taken a stand against, racism, discrimination and systemic oppression and listed their 20 demands in a memorandum. The matric learners at Bishops Diocesan College held a protest and drafted a memorandum documenting a list of their demands and experiences of racism and discrimination which they handed over to the school. "We are approaching you as a matric year in its entirety, and not as a certain demographic or minority, to demand that action is taken to ensure that every one of our fellow students are treated as equals within a system that has, for so long, treated them as anything but." the pupils said in a memorandum (which can be seen in full below). Pupils from more than 20 elite Cape high schools have also exposed what they deem blatant racism at private and former Model C schools. This is the list of demands that Bishops matrics want to be implemented at the school:   Guy Pearson, outgoing principal of Bishops, said his executive team had received the memorandum. “This will be an ideal opportunity to continue the engagement with all members of our community regarding these issues in our school,” Pearson said. “We are committed to making Bishops a welcoming environment for all who learn and work here, irrespective of their race, religion, gender, or sexual orientation.”   * Additional reporting by Chelsea Geach.
