IT’s been a rough year so the Haines family from Fish Hoek are hoping to spread some cheer by decorating their home with more than 100 000 Christmas lights. The display has become a annual favourite in the sea side town. People tried to donate money for the Haines family’s electricity bill which they never accepted, but instead donate to a charity. This year’s beneficiary is TEARS Foundation that support rape victims, and  children of Masiphumelele and Ocean View. “We are focusing on bringing some Christmas joy to the children of Masiphumelele and Ocean View. We are accepting clothing, food and money. Anything that we can give back to these areas that are in need,” said Matthew Haines. The lights are on from 8pm to 11pm nightly. “The cost to run the display is quite high, but it's our family's gift to the area. Fish Hoek is an amazing place to call home and we have the best neighbours,” he said. This year due to Covid-19, the family takes a much more careful approach to visitors. “People are welcome to come into the yard to see the lights, but masks are mandatory and we will be checking temperatures, as well as sanitizing hands before entering the yard,” he added. Donations of used clothes and non-perishable food items are welcome.
