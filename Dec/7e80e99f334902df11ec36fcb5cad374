Situated among the fynbos-clad mountains and bordered by white beaches and blue sea, Deep South lends its name and identity from its surroundings as the southernmost distillery in Cape Town. Kommetjie is the perfect place for a quirky, interesting, versatile, and professional little distillery that brings together the chemistry of flavour, the science of distilling great spirits in the company of good friends. The distillery is located in a small industrial area on the road that links Kommetjie to the rest of the Cape. The distillery is artisanal, which means premium spirits are manufactured in small batches, for discerning lovers of craft spirits. The fermentation and distillation processes are hands-on, bottling and labelling are also done by hand. The manufacture, settling and maturation of the spirits is allowed to unfold at an unhurried pace, and even the distillery tour and tasting are conducted at a leisurely pace. The result is an authentic, personalised craft experience, and exceptional spirits that are made with care and passion. Deep South Distillery is a warm, friendly craft distillery that shares knowledge and fun in equal measure and well on track to fulfilling its mission: to make the world a better place, one sip at a time.
