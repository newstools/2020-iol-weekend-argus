Cape Town - A Cape Town boy has been rushed to hospital after allegedly being struck in the head by a bullet during a shooting between rival gangs. Just after 11am on Monday, Nahemiah Claassen, 10, a Grade 6 learner at Parkwood Primary, was rushed to the Red Cross Children’s Hospital.

Nahemiah lay just off the pavement as members of the community rushed to his aid. The young boy was covered with a brown blanket. Nahemiah’s cousin, Chad Crowley, 24, told African News Agency: “His mother is with him (at the hospital). The rest of the family is here at the house and we are all awaiting news. “Everyone is distraught and we’re just praying for the best.” Provincial police spokesperson Colonel André Traut confirmed the shooting incident and said members of the Grassy Park South African Police Service (SAPS) had arrested a 22-year-old suspect. The second suspect is yet to be found.

Traut said the SAPS believes the suspects are affiliated to a local gang and asked the public assist the police with information on the whereabouts of the second suspect. African News Agency (ANA)
