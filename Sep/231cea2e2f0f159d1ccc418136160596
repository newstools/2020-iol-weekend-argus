FIVE staff members from the Cape of Good Hope SPCA animal hospital took on an abseil challenge down Table Mountain on Saturday in connection with a fundraiser to purchase a bone plating kit. Bone plates are used to immobilise bone segments. The plate has screws attached to it, to properly align the bone and aid in the healing process. The animal welfare organisation’s head vet, Dr Mark Middleton, wanted a bone plating kit so that he could save the life and limb of every orthopaedic animal patient that needs him. The SPCA needed to raise R150 000 through their fundraising campaign Pawfeet Love #savelifeandlimb, which started last month. They have raised almost R200 000 and they were able to purchase the kit, additional plates and some extra surgical implements. “Broken bones at the SPCA were breaking our hearts, because we often didn’t have the tools to help animals with fractures,” said spokesperson Belinda Abraham. Participants signed up to take part in their first virtual doggie walkathon. They were simply walked to honour those whose broken bones, explained Abraham. Middleton agreed to boost the campaign by doing a dare devil stunt. He took to social media to do his part for the campaign and in exchange for donations of R10 000, promised to abseil off Table Mountain. “There is so much more to do with the equipment that we procured during the fundraising initiative,” he said. He told Weekend Argus that the equipment would serve them for an extremely long time in future and help change the lives of many animals. “The experience of the abseil was incredible. We would like to thank all who donated to raise funds for the orthopaedic equipment,” said Middleton. Meanwhile, Leonard Ndakisa (theatre nurse), said that the experience was amazing. “I felt like I had to do it because people had been so generous in their support. I really wanted to do it as a show of thanks,” he said. Weekend Argus
