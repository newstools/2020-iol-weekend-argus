Malcolm Stephens, Fidelity Security Group Executive New Business Development, said the golden rule if you ever are caught in the middle of a heist is to stay calm. Stephens said customers need to remain vigilant at all times and should always be on the lookout for any suspicious activities and be aware of the people around them. "Whether you were in the store being robbed, or just witnessed the incident in the Centre, you should seek counselling, regardless of how you might feel. It often takes some time to experience and deal with the post-traumatic stress following such robberies," Stephens said. sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za Cape Argus
